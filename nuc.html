		<h2>THE STORY</h2>
		<p>Fission takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, during a nuclear winter caused by a coordinated attack on the world's biggest nuclear reactors. You play as Viktor Patsayev, an ex-KGB agent working with MI6. Informed by MI6, Viktor bunkered down during the explosion. The organisation that attacked the reactors is still at large, and it falls onto you to stop them. You are the last hope of earth's survivors.</p>
