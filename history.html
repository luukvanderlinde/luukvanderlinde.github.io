		<h2>Founding</h2>
		<p>PSV Eindhoven was founded in 1913, to fulfill the need for activities with Dutch tech giant Philips. The predecessor of PSV - Philips Elftal - was founded in 1910, but was quickly dissolved following financial issues and worker strikes. World War I meant that they could not join a league until the 1915-1916 season. Ever since 1926, PSV has played in the highest domestic league, and have cemented themselves as titans of Dutch football, alongside teams Ajax Amsterdam and Feyenoord Rotterdam. World War II also damaged PSV, as it meant less attendance, and young talent Johan Brusselers passed away in the war. PSV found succcess after the war, signing super striker Coen Dillen, becoming the first Dutch team to enter the European Champion Clubs' Cup (now known as the champions league), and much more.</p>
